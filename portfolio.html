        <h3>My Personal Website</h3>
        <p>This website is my first web development project. 
            It's meant to highlight who I am, what my skills are and to back it up. 
            I built this website over the course of a week from scratch using HTML and CSS. 
            I chose not to use a website building tool like GoDaddy or Squarespace because I wanted to learn more about how front-end web development works. 
            Iâ€™m proud of how this website has turned out so far and I plan to continue adding features and improving it as I learn.
            <ul>
                <li>Built using HTML with CSS styling</li>
                <li>Hosted using GitHub pages</li>
                <li>Built to allow many of my programs to run in-browser without downloading source code.</li>
                <li>continued support and updates</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <h3>Weather App</h3>
            <p>This Program was built to practice making GUIs in python and working with API's.
                This program uses OpenWeathers One Call API. It allows the user to enter a city and recive information on the weather there.
                
                <ul>
                    <li>GUI is made with the PyQt5 module </li>
                    <li>Coded in pyhthon</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>UMES Banking App</h3>
            <p> This was a team project that I had a leadership role in. My team Developed a mock hospital patient data portal and database system. It was designed to store and manage 
                "patient" information securely. This project enables patients to access and update their records, schedule 
                appointments, and view medical history while ensuring healthcare providers have a streamlined data 
                retrieval system.
